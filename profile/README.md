# üåê Geographic Information Systems Spatial Analysis Laboratory

The [Geographic Information Systems Spatial Analysis Laboratory (GISSAL)](https://www.ksu.edu/gissal) is a university core facility established in 1990 as an interdisciplinary center supporting geospatial research, learning, and outreach activities at Kansas State University. Since 2000, GISSAL researchers have been principal or co-principal investigators on externally-funded research projects totaling more than $8 million in collaboration with over 40 organizations across the nation and world.

GISSAL has been recognized as a National Center of Digitizing Excellence by the USDA Natural Resource Conservation Service, was a key contributor to the 2005 ESRI Special Achievement in GIS Award for Agriculture awarded to Kansas State University, and was part of the team awarded the Range and Training Land Assessment (RTLA) Program of the Year in 2011 by the Department of the Army.

Although primarily a research facility, GISSAL also offers a suite of [contract services](https://www.k-state.edu/gissal/services/) to support research, scholarly and creative activities, and discovery (RSCAD) for clients both on and off campus.
